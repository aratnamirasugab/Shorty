Shorty Challenge
================

## The Challenge

The challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to create a micro service to shorten urls, in the style that TinyURL and bit.ly made popular.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The service must expose HTTP endpoints according to the definition below.
2. The service must be self contained in a Docker image, but it must be possible to set it up from a fresh install of Ubuntu Server latest LTS, by following the steps you write in the README.
3. It must be well tested, it must also be possible to run the entire test suit with a single command from the directory of your repository.
4. The service must be versioned using git and git history **should** be meaningful.
5. You don't have to use a datastore, you can have all data in memory, but you are free if you wanto do use one.

## Tips

* Less is more, small is beautiful, you know the drill — stick to the requirements.
* Use the right tool for the job.
* No need to take care of domains, that's for a reverse proxy to handle.
* Unit tests > Integration tests, but be careful with untested parts of the system.

**Good Luck!** — not that you need any ;)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
